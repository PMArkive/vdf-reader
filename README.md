# vdf-reader

A parser for Valve's Data Format v1 (VDF) also known as [KeyValues](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/KeyValues).

The parser focuses on being able to deal with all the various weird forms vdf takes in the wild and providing access to the data stream instead of always requiring parsing the file in full.
